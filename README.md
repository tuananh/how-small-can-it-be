How small can it be?
--------------------

# Pretty damn small!

A demonstration using [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) native image, [melange](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange), [apko](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko) & [Wolfi Linux](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os) to build a tiny tiny Java application.

The end goal is to see how small Java application container image can be.

## How?

- Since there's no GraalVM package for Wolfi Linux, I just need to quickly package it in a dirty way using [melange](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange).

- After that, I package [my application](./src/App.java) with melange again, using the `native-image` package from the Melange package I got earlier.

- Finally, I use [apko](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko) to produce the final container image. You can do multi-arch easily with apko along with other benefits like automatic SBOM generation, reproducible by default, etc.. but for the scope of this weekend hack, I just do `amd64` only.

```sh
make native-image-pkg
make tiny-java-app-pkg
make container-image
docker load < tiny-java-app.tar
docker run tiny-java-app:latest
```

## Result

The image is 23.1 MB decompressed and 8.6MB compressed.

Along with all other benefits of the Chainguard's stack:

- Fully reproducible by default
- SBOM support
- Multi-arch
- etc...

```
docker images | grep tiny
tiny-java-app                                 latest         80ac5468534c   53 years ago    23.1MB
```
